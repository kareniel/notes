# Personality (Big Five Aspects Scale)

Where I stand in comparison to others in the general population on the 
major traits and their aspects:

- **Agreeableness**: typical (54)
- **Conscientiousness**: low (17)
- **Extraversion**: typical (40)
- **Neuroticism**: high (84)
- **Openness to experience**: very high (95) 


## typically compassionate (55)

- make time and do kind things for other, but balance that with fulfilling their own needs and interests
- have a soft side, but are not pushovers
- Other people consider them reasonably sympathetic and nice, and will sometimes turn to them for a listening ear
- can be empathetic and caring
- are not primarily other-oriented, so they can negotiate effectively on their own behalf


## typically polite (52)

- can be deferential to authority, but can also be challenging, when necessary.
- not particularly obedient
- can be respectful, but will also push back if pushed
- typically polite people will avoid conflict, reasonably, but are not completely averse to confrontation.


## low in industriousness (17)

- much less likely to be successful in school and in administrative and managerial positions
- tend to be regarded as underachievers
- focus less on work than others and are substantively more likely to procrastinate, miss deadlines, or fail to complete assignments or projects completely
- put off responsibilities, concentrating more on fun, worry, relationships, excitement or creative endeavour
- aren’t concerned with schedules, timelines or efficiency, and will have to be supervised excessively before their tasks will be completed
- lack focus and are too-easily distracted
- not judgmental to themselves or others
- let people, including themselves, off the hook
- resistant to guilt, self-disgust or self-contempt, and have a very laissez-faire, whatever-will-be-will-be attitude toward life.


## moderately low in orderliness (14)

- tend simply not to notice mess and chaos
- see the world in shades of grey, rather than black and white, and are non-judgmental in their attitudes toward themselves and others
- rarely use schedules, list, or routines and, even if they plan, tend not to implement those plans, preferring to take things as they come, and let chance determine the outcome
- not oriented toward detail and take neither rules nor procedures too seriously
- care less than average for routine and predictability
- require almost constant reminder and supervision to maintain attention and focus, easily distracted
- can tolerate the mess, disruption and intervening periods of chaos that may accompany creative endeavour


## moderately high in enthusiasm (75)

- somewhat excitable, happy and easier to get to know
- will talk more about everything
- laugh or giggle more than average
- don’t generally keep people at a distance
- not too concerned with keeping things private
- comparatively positive and optimistic
- warm up quickly to other people
- gregarious, encouraging and people-loving

## low in assertiveness (15)

- not known to be “take charge” types
- put their own opinions forward rarely and with reservation, and do not typically attempt to dominate and control social situations
- manifest much less of the communication style that is often associated with leadership
- (can be a handicap when they are knowledgeable, competent and able)
- don’t leap in heedlessly and, in consequence, tend to allow others to lead the way
- much less impulsive, in consequence, and hardly ever act without thinking.

## very high in withdrawal (93)

- may feel extreme levels of anticipatory anxiety
- makes it very much more challenging for them to approach new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations
- very much more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected
- more likely to feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken
- very high levels of doubt and worry, become embarrassed easily, are self-conscious and get discouraged rapidly in the face of threat and punishment
- very sensitive to social rejection, and can be easily hurt
- once hurt, frightened, or anxious, as well, it takes them a long time to recover


## moderately high in volatility (63)

- tend to vary somewhat in their mood
- can be more irritable than the typical person, feeling disappointment, frustration, pain and social isolation somewhat more easily
- can sometimes be provocative in a dispute


## exceptionally high in intellect (96)

- obsessed by engaging with ideas and abstract concepts
- require exposure to novel information, particularly when it is complex and sophisticated
- extremely curious and exploratory, and actively need to find, tackle and solve challenging problems
- will constantly seek out and initiate issue-oriented discussions, and tend to compulsively read, think about and discuss idea-centered books (generally non-fiction). 
- continually require themselves to learn new things
- will continually find and generate novel, creative concepts and voluntarily search for and adapt exceptionally well to new experience and situations
- find complex, rapidly changing occupations asbolutely necessary and will excel at them
- not at all suited to stable, straightforward and more traditional occupations, where the rules don't change, and will experience continual periods of boredom and intolerable levels of frustration in such positions
