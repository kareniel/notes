# Brahmacharya

> What's more important is what he considered to be a "virtuous person": someone who has perfected the path and completely abandoned greed, aversion and delusion - an arahant. The life of a bhikkhu is considered the vehicle for attaining to this state. Even the best practising laypeople in Buddhist history - the most generous, virtuous, skilled in samadhi - haven't been recorded as achieving this.

> The robes, precept, vinaya, way of life, alms round, etc have all been fabricated with only one purpose - That is hastened purification and eradication of avijja, final deliverance. They offer much opportunity & protection that makes the way simpler and easier. So, if you have the potential to reach arahatship in this life, then becoming a Bhikkhu will only maximize that probability 

> I  don't know about what's allowed for monks, but I haven't read fiction books or watched films which are made for 'entertainment' for a long time. It happened naturally, not deliberately. I just don't have any interest in reading/watching other peoples emotional dramas and fantasies.This isn't a criticism of those who do, I think "different stokes for different folks" probably sums it up.

> It is best if your mother comes to terms with the idea of separation sooner rather than later. We are all separated from family members by death, which can happen to either party at any time. If two people are in the same room, but one is thinking of Dhamma, while the other is thinking about worldly things, they are far apart.

> the family of a monastic definitely goes through a loss, but it's nothing compared to the loss of death, at least to those who truly understand and contemplate these things. I am beginning to see my renunciation as not only a gift to myself, but to everyone else who knows me as well, a well needed lesson in loss that will hopefully propel them even that little inch closer to seeking the dhamma in future lives.

> Let us pay close attention to ourselves so that we are not deceived into thinking that we are following the strait and narrow way when in actual fact we are keeping to the wide and broad way. The following will show you what the narrow way means: mortification of the stomach, all-night standing, water in moderation, short rations of bread, the purifying draught of dishonour, sneers, derision, insults, the cutting out of one’s own will, patience in annoyances, unmurmuring endurance of scorn, disregard of insults, and the habit, when wronged, of bearing it sturdily; when slandered, of not being indignant; when humiliated, not to be angry; when condemned, to be humble. Blessed are they who follow the way we have just described, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
